# Break Reminder
A lot of us suffer from backpain, eye-strain, and other related problems while working for longer hours without taking any breaks. So I spent some minutes writing a Python script that reminds us to take a break after every 20 minutes for 5 minutes while we are working. As a reminder, it plays your favorite song. 

P.S. It's your responsibility to get back to work after 5 minutes of break as the script will be running in the background :P It will remind you to take a break again after 20 minutes after you take a 5 minute break. 

Feel free to link up a song of your choice. Since it's [Navaratri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navaratri) season and I love listening to [Garbas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garba_(dance)), I've linked up them.
